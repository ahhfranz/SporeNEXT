# Spore NEXT Launcher

**Spore NEXT Launcher** is an open-source mod manager designed to make installing, updating, and removing mods for Spore: Galactic Adventures effortless.
Originally created just to install an HD Textures mod pack, the launcher has evolved into a mod catalog where players can either install or uninstall a variety of mods with just a few clicks. (Work in progress)

This project is fully non-profit and built as part of my learning journey with JavaScript and Electron.js.
It’s still an early release, so some bugs may appear — updates and fixes will be rolled out continuously based on community feedback.
